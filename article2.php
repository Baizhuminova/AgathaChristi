            <h2>Agatha Christie will: World’s best-selling author’s staggering fortune & who inherited it</h2>
            <h5>AGATHA CHRISTIE has always been a household name. Having amassed such a fortune from her iconic novels and plays, who inherited it?</h5>
            <div class="fakeimg"><img class="img1" src="img/3840d384b6bf5a80d4dbcbe054140f4b--agatha-christie-dame.jpg"> </div>
            <br>
            <p class="para">Agatha Christie became, and remains, the best-selling novelist of all time.
                She is best known for her detective novels and short story collections, as well as the world’s longest-running play,
                The Mousetrap. Her books have sold over a billion copies in the English language and a billion in translation.
                With such an incredible career, Agatha made a lot of money, and when she died in 1976, she left behind a huge fortune that was inherited by family members.
                And to this day, Agatha Christie still makes money. </p>

            <h3 class="para">Agatha Christie’s net worth</h3>
            <br>
            <p class="para">Newspapers, websites and several entities’ estimates of Agatha Christie’s fortune vary.
                At the time of her death in 1976, one estimate of her total earnings from more than a half-century of writing was £14.8million (approximately £677million in 2020).
                On the other hand, thisismoney.co.uk, suggests Agatha Christie’s net worth was around £40m, as of 2010.
                While Agatha made a lot of money, she was known to be a shrewd businesswoman, anxious to avoid leaving too much of her fortune to the taxman.
                She once said: “I only write one book a year now, which is sufficient to give me a good income.
                “If I wrote more, I’d enlarge the finances of the Inland Revenue who would spend it mostly on idiotic things.”</p> <br>

            <p class="para">As for who inherited Agatha’s fortune when she died, her daughter Rosalind was the main beneficiary.
                Not only did Agatha’s daughter inherit money, but she also received 36 percent of Agatha Christie Limited and the copyrights to Christie’s play A Daughter’s a Daughter.
                Agatha’s grandson, Mathew Prichard, was also a beneficiary, who received the sole rights to The Mousetrap for his ninth birthday.
                Following the death of his mother in 2004, Matthew was put in charge of Agatha Christie Ltd, collecting royalties on the books, plays and short stories.
                Speaking about taking on the role, Matthew told irishtimes.com: “I am a sort of glorified brand manager. I am the one to say whether something is good for the Agatha Christie brand.”
                He recently sold video game rights for several million pounds and has also cashed in by selling a £10m stake to Chorion entertainment in 1998.
